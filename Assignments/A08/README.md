## Assignment 8 - Public Key Encryption
#### Name: Sarah Gilliland
#### Due: Tuesday, November 10, 2020

### General Problem
This project will use an existing python library called cryptography (appropriately named) to use public key encryption 
to encrypt and decrypt messages sent between two entities.  We will use a library called Flask to allow two scripts
to "talk" or communicate over a network (NOT on the same computer). 
A Flask server runs and "listens" or monitors a "port" on a computer. When requests are directed to that port either from
an internal request or an external request, they are handled by the process monitoring the port, or in our case Flask.

A request can either ask for information (GET) or send information (POST). There are variations of requests that imply 
different actions, but we will get by with GET and POST for our project. [Here](https://github.com/rugbyprof/4663-Cryptography/blob/master/Assignments/A08/README.md) is a link to
the project description from Dr. Griffin, which includes an illustration of how this happens.
