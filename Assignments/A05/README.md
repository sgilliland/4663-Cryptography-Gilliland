## Assignment 5 - Vigenere Cracking
#### Name: Sarah Gilliland
#### Due: Tuesday, September 29, 2020

### General Problem
Decrypt a file which was encrypted by the Vigenere Algorithm.
Write a python program that will discover the size of that dictionary word (keylength) and then determine which word was used to encrypt your file(s).
