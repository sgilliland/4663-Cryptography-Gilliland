#### Lucas-Lehmer Test
The Lucas-Lehmer Test is a deterministic algorithm and is the primality test used by the
[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Internet_Mersenne_Prime_Search) (GIMPS) to locate large primes. 
This search has been successful in locating many of the largest primes known to date.
In 1878, E. Lucas proposed two tests for the primality of the Mersenne number, N = 2n − 1. 
However, neither was accompanied by a complete proof. In 1930, and as part of his Ph.D. thesis, 
D. H. Lehmer stated and proved a necessary and sufficient condition for N to be prime. 
This result has become known as the Lucas–Lehmer test. It is usually stated as in Theorem 1.
