## Assignment 5 - Vigenere Cracking
#### Name: Sarah Gilliland
#### Due: Tuesday, September 29, 2020

### General Problem
Decrypt a file which was encrypted by the Vigenere Algorithm.
Write a python program that will discover the size of that dictionary word (keylength) and then determine which word was used to encrypt your file(s).

### Files

|   #   | File                       | Description                                                |

|   1   | [break_vig.py](https://github.com/sgilliland/4663-Cryptography-Gilliland/blob/master/Assignments/A05/break_vig.py)     | Main program used for this assignment       |
|   2   | [input](https://github.com/sgilliland/4663-Cryptography-Gilliland/blob/master/Assignments/A05/input)     | Input file to read in the encrypted text       |
|   3   | [output](https://github.com/sgilliland/4663-Cryptography-Gilliland/blob/master/Assignments/A05/output)     | Output file to display the keylength, keyword, and plain text       |
|   4   | [input2](https://github.com/sgilliland/4663-Cryptography-Gilliland/blob/master/Assignments/A05/input2)     | Input file used for testing code       |
